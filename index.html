				Hi, My name is Victor Adeshile and I am a Software Engineer. I
				love to code and solve business problems with my logic and
				design concepts. BYU Pathway is really been a great blessing to
				many including myself and my Family. Having to pursue my Degree
				is live changing. I have experienced yet another Miracle because
				of BYU Pathway! I am eternally grateful to my loving Heavenly
				Father. Massive thanks to all those who have made this possible.
				Open for collaboration. Thanks.

				The modern State of Osun was created on 27 August 1991 from
				part... of the old Oyo State. The state's name is derived from
				the River Osun, the venerated natural spring that is the
				manifestation of the Yoruba goddess of the same name.
